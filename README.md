This is a terraform code for a basic AWS VPC, which includes IGW,NATGW,public &private subnets for the VPC.Based on this VPC module, I have created a multi-tier wordpress deployment and you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/antony-a-n/multi-tier-wordpress-deployment-with-terraform/).
